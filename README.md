## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Create a namespace for the Metrics Operator.
2. Create a secret containing the credentials for the artifactory (read-only) in the operator's namespace.
3. Create a secret containing the data sink credentials in the operator's namespace.

### Deployment

Deploy the Metrics Operator using the Helm chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install co-metrics-operator deploy-releases-hyperspace-helm/co-metrics-operator \
  --namespace <operator-namespace> \
  --create-namespace \
  --set imagePullSecrets[0].name=<artifactory-secret-name> \
  --version=<version>
```

Replace `<operator-namespace>`, `<artifactory-secret-name>`, and `<version>` with appropriate values.

## Usage

### Metric

Metrics have additional capabilities, such as projections. Projections allow you to extract specific fields from the target resource and include them in the metric data.
This can be useful for tracking additional dimensions of the resource, such as fields, labels or annotations. It uses the dot notation to access nested fields.
The projections are then translated to dimensions in the metric.

```yaml
apiVersion: metrics.cloud.sap/v1alpha
kind: Metric
metadata:
  name: comp-pod
spec:
  name: comp-metric-pods
  description: Pods
  target:
    resource: pods
    group: ""
    version: v1
  frequency: 1 # in minutes
  projections:
    - name: pod-namespace
      fieldPath: "metadata.namespace"
---
```

### Federated Metric
Federated metrics deal with resources that are spread across multiple clusters. To monitor these resources, you need to define a `FederatedMetric` resource.
They offer capabilities to aggregate data as well as filtering down to a specific cluster or field using projections.
```yaml
apiVersion: metrics.cloud.sap/v1beta1
kind: FederatedMetric
metadata:
  name: xfed-prov
spec:
  name: xfed-prov
  description: crossplane providers
  target:
    group:  pkg.crossplane.io
    resource: providers
    version: v1
  frequency: 1 # in minutes
  projections:
    - name: package
      fieldPath: "spec.package"
  federateCaRef:
    name: federate-ca-sample
    namespace: default
---

```

### Federated Managed Metric
This is a special use case metric, it is looking at all the crossplane managed resource across all clusters.
The pre-condition here is that if a resource comes from a crossplane provider, its CRD should have categories "crossplane" and "managed".


```yaml
apiVersion: metrics.cloud.sap/v1beta1
kind: FederatedManagedMetric
metadata:
  name: xfed-managed
spec:
  name: xfed-managed
  description: crossplane managed resources
  frequency: 1 # in minutes
  federateCaRef:
    name: federate-ca-sample
    namespace: default
---
```

## Remote Cluster Access


### Cluster Access
The Metrics Operator can monitor both the cluster it's deployed in and remote clusters. To monitor a remote cluster, define a `ClusterAccess` resource:

This cluster access resource can be used by `CompoundMetric` resources to monitor resources in the remote cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: metrics.cloud.sap/v1beta1
kind: ClusterAccess
metadata:
  name: remote-cluster
  namespace: <monitoring-namespace>
spec:
  remoteClusterConfig:
    clusterSecretRef:
      name: remote-cluster-secret
      namespace: <secret-namespace>
    serviceAccountName: <service-account-name>
    serviceAccountNamespace: <service-account-namespace>
```


### Federated Cluster Access

To monitor resources across multiple clusters, define a `FederatedClusterAccess` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: metrics.cloud.sap/v1beta1
kind: FederatedClusterAccess
metadata:
  name: federate-ca-sample
  namespace: default
spec:
  target:
    group: core.orchestrate.cloud.sap
    resource: controlplanes #plural always, lowecase only
    version: v1beta1
  kubeConfigPath: spec.target.kubeconfig #case sensitive
```


## RBAC Configuration

The Metrics Operator requires appropriate permissions to monitor the resources you specify. You need to configure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to grant these permissions. Here's an example of how to create a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding for the Metrics Operator:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: metrics-operator-role
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - "example.group"
  resources:
  - "exampleresources"
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: metrics-operator-rolebinding
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: metrics-operator-sa
  namespace: <operator-namespace>
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: metrics-operator-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Replace `<operator-namespace>` with the namespace where the Metrics Operator is deployed. Adjust the `apiGroups` and `resources` fields to match the resources you want to monitor.

Apply the RBAC configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f rbac-config.yaml
```

Remember to update this RBAC configuration whenever you add new resource types to monitor.


## Data Sink Integration

The Metrics Operator sends collected data to a configured data sink for storage and analysis. The data sink (e.g., Dynatrace) provides tools for data aggregation, filtering, and visualization.

To make the most of your metrics:

1. Configure your data sink according to its documentation.
2. Use the data sink's query language or UI to create custom views of your metrics.
3. Set up alerts based on metric thresholds or patterns.
4. Leverage the data sink's analysis tools to gain insights into your system's behavior and performance.

For specific instructions on using your data sink's features, refer to its documentation. For example, if using Dynatrace, consult the Dynatrace documentation for information on creating custom charts, setting up alerts, and performing advanced analytics on your metric data.


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
make dev-local-all
```

2. Run the controller:

```sh
make dev-run
```
Or run it from your IDE.

### Delete Kind Cluster
Delete Kind cluster
```sh
make dev-clean
```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests generate
```
